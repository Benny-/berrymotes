# Emote server

A [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application. Simple CRUD operations for emoticons.

Please see the independent [reddit_emote_scraper](reddit_emote_scraper) sub-application for scraping emotes from Reddit.

The emote server is designed to import the results from the reddit_emote_scraper and acts as a complete replacement to using reddit as a emoticon hosting site.

This project is in pre-alpha (non-functioning).

## Motivation

Reddit is not designed as a emote hosting site and never will be. There are limitations set on images (no .gif or .svg's allowed) and a limit amount of emoticons per subreddit. Adding emotes can be unnecessary complicated and error-prone. And there is no ability to tag or search emoticons.

Also, it can be considered rude to use someone's CDN for something it was never intended for.

## Roadmap

The server will provide a api for sumbitting, altering, removing, tagging and searching emoticons.

The server will not be a replacement for grading emoticons for submission, nor will this project contain any material to consume the emoticons.
