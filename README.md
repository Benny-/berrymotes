# Emote server

A [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application. Simple CRUD operations for emoticons.

Please see the independent [reddit_emote_scraper](reddit_emote_scraper) sub-application for scraping emotes from Reddit.

The emote server is designed to import the results from the reddit_emote_scraper.

This project is in pre-alpha (non-functioning).
